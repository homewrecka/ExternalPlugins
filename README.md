## Plugins
* __Auto Clicker__: This plugin will automatically click where you are hovering when you press the hotkey.
* __Auto Pray Flick__: This plugin will attempt to automatically flick your prayers, simply place your cursor over the prayer orb, and press the hotkey.
* __Custom Swapper__: One of the more robust plugins, this allows you to execute prebaked commands, such as Equip, Prayer, Cast, Remove, and so on. You can for instance, equip a set of gear, enable your prayer, then activate special all in one hotkey!
* __Item Dropper__:  Pretty self-explanatory, put the ids of the items you want to drop into the config field, and then hit the hotkey. Voila, pesky items begone.
* __Left Click Cast__: Whenever you're wielding a staff or wand, it will change your Attack entry into a Cast entry, based on what spell you have set in the config. Now you too can become decent at PvP!
* __Never Log__: Activate the plugin, and it will make it so you wont logout until you hit the forced logout timer.
* __Nylo Swapper__: This will change your gear and prayers during the Nylocas fight in Theatre of Blood.
* __Olm Swapper__: This will change your prayers during the Olm encounter at Chambers of Xeric.
* __One Click__: Probably the most popular plugin, this plugin allows you to simplify quite a large variety of tasks by reducing the amount of clicks to... 1. For instance, instead of clicking a bone and using it on the altar, just click the altar, or set a custom one inventory one click in the config. You could for instance set it to use an Apple on an Orange in one click if you desired.
